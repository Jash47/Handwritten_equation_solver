## Introduction
The Handwritten Equation Solver using CNN project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to recognize and solve handwritten mathematical equations. The project utilizes a CNN architecture to perform image recognition and classification tasks.

## Dataset
To train the CNN model, a carefully curated dataset of handwritten mathematical equations is required. The dataset should consist of a wide variety of equations written by different individuals. It is essential to have a sufficient number of labeled images for each equation type to ensure effective training.

## CNN Architecture
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture plays a crucial role in accurately recognizing and solving handwritten equations. It typically comprises several convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. The exact architecture can vary based on the specific requirements of the project and can be customized to achieve optimal performance.

## Model Training
To train the CNN model, the handwritten equation dataset is divided into training and validation sets. The model is trained using the training set, and the validation set is used to evaluate its performance and fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary. The training process involves forward and backward propagation, with the aim of minimizing the loss function and improving accuracy.

## Usage
To use the Handwritten Equation Solver, follow these steps:

1. Prepare the handwritten equation image that needs to be solved.
2. Preprocess the image by resizing, normalizing, and converting it to the appropriate format.
3. Load the trained CNN model.
4. Feed the preprocessed image into the model for prediction.
5. Obtain the predicted equation and the corresponding solution.

Ensure that all required dependencies are installed before running the solver.
